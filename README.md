# Chaotic-Pendulum-Encrytion
This is the project page for our Chatoic Pendulum Encrytion system. A driven double pendulum is by nature a chaotic system, meaning it is highly dependent on, and sensitive to initial conditions. The idea behind this project is to utilize this chaos to produce highly variable keys and encrypt data via symmetric stream cypher. We design a pendulum using aluminum, and to detect its motion, we use neodymium magnets and hall effect sensors. To encrypt a message, we collect a series of bytes from the pendulum and use this as our key. 
Since we can collect data very quickly, an encryption of this sort is theoretically very secure where we can make the key the same length as the message.

## Circuits 
For the setup we used three circuits, one to run the motor, another for the op-amp, and a third to connect three to four the sensors. 

### Motor circuit 
Using a DRV8833 motor driver we connect a 12V, 100RPM DC motor

# Control of Pendulum
We use a LabJack U3-HV and a DC Power Supply to control the motor and collect data. 


The process begins when a message is given to the program to be encrypted and initial conditions specified
(though, in reality, the latter in unnecessary because each time they will be different anyways). Once
the device is triggered, the fixed positions of the arms are released and the motor begins oscillating. 

Choosing Frequency and comparing to the natural frequency. . . 

For the pendulum to swing chaoticly we set a low frequency 


The two big things are the cutoff voltage and obtaining chaotic motion.




### Testing and Changes 

Plot for cuttoff voltage value:




### Randomness

There are a few places to look for randomness when looking at the data collected by the sensors.

GRAPHS and analysis of them

Using our knowledge of aproximately where the data is systematic and where it is random, we set a cut

### Ex. 2

We can compare the normalizad data for the ordered motion vs. the chaotic motion. 

Ordered:

Encryption with the chaotic:
The input is: b' hello world' 

The key is: b'b\x15J\x801ET\x13\x12\x91\x1a\x06\x80\x12$\x04E\x01' 

The encrypted data is: b'B}/\xec]*#3e\xfehj\xe4'

The decrypted data is:  Abracadabra


Ordered:

What do you want to encrypt?Abracadabra
The input is: b'Abracadabra' 

The key is: b'\x1b\x93\x9b\x99\x9b\x931\xb9\x99\x99\x99\x99\xa1\x91\x9b\x99\x99\x99\x99\x99' 

The encrypted data is: b'Z\xf1\xe9\xf8\xf8\xf2U\xd8\xfb\xeb\xf8' 

The decrypted data is: Abracadabra



Notice the repetition in the ordered sequence as apposed to the chaotic sequence for the encrypted data. 

# Conclusion

In this project w
The use of hall effect sensors is not recommended for such a set up, they break very easily and something more reliable would serve much better. 

There is a endless amount of data analysis one can do to find the most randomized keys.

The great thing is that with the chatoic system the key will obvioulsy not be guessed. Hypothetically if we use the sinusoidal wave for encryption we get a string of zeros and ones, which will encrypt the message without problems. Obviously this is not safe since it is very easy to deduce they key.
