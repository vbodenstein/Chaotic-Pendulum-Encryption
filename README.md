# Chaotic-Pendulum-Encrytion
This is the project page for our Chatoic Pendulum Encrytion system. 

A driven double pendulum is by nature a chaotic system, meaning it is highly dependent on, and sensitive, to
initial conditions. Utilizing this fact, we can extract sequences of numbers producing a randomized key. Each time the
pendulum starts, itâ€™s path will be different unless the starting conditions are exactly identical. In a physical system
however, this is nearly impossible, making it an interesting case for encryption. Using hall affect sensors we will
detect when the pendulum passes certain positions and use this to encode a cipher.
