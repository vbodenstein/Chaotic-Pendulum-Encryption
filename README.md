# Chaotic-Pendulum-Encrytion
This is the project page for our Chatoic Pendulum Encrytion system. A driven double pendulum is by nature a chaotic system, meaning it is highly dependent on, and sensitive to initial conditions. The idea behind this project is to utilize this chaos to produce highly variable keys and encrypt data via symmetric stream cypher. We design a pendulum using aluminum, and to detect its motion, we use neodymium magnets and hall effect sensors. To encrypt a message, we collect a series of bytes from the pendulum and use this as our key. 
Since we can collect data very quickly, an encryption of this sort is theoretically very secure where we can make the key the same length as the message.

## Circuits 
For the setup we used three circuits, one to run the motor, another for the op-amp, and a third to connect three to four the sensors. 

### Motor circuit 
Using a DRV8833 motor driver we connect a 12V, 100RPM DC motor

### Sensor Circuit

### Op-Amp Circuit

Linear Hall Effect Sensors are connect in a circuit with an op-amp



# Control of Pendulum
We use a LabJack U3-HV and a DC Power Supply to control the motor and collect data. 


The process begins when a message is given to the program to be encrypted and initial conditions specified
(though, in reality, the latter in unnecessary because each time they will be different anyways). Once
the device is triggered, the fixed positions of the arms are released and the motor begins oscillating. 

Choosing Frequency and comparing to the natural frequency. . . 

For the pendulum to swing chaoticly we set a low frequency 


The two big things are the cutoff voltage and obtaining chaotic motion.




### Testing and Changes 

Plot for cuttoff voltage value:




### Randomness

There are a few places to look for randomness when looking at the data collected by the sensors.

GRAPHS and analysis of them

Using our knowledge of aproximately where the data is systematic and where it is random, we set a cut





# Encryption Results


### Examples of encryption and decryption: 


### Ex. 1 
Text: Hello World:
0100100001100101011011000110110001101111001000000101011101101111011100100110110001100100

Key Generated by our chaotic device:
0011001000110100001101100011000000110000001110010011010000110100001100000011100000111000

Ciphertext:
0111101001010001010110100101110001011111000110010110001101011011010000100101010001011100

Translates:
zQZ c[BT

In this example the text is short so the chaotic system wouldnâ€™t need to run for very long, the whole process
would be done quite fast.

### Ex. 2

The data generated by the device:

00010101011010101011010101101010111001010110011110101001110101101110101001000010011001110110100000000100111001100111110011000111010110101001010100100100100110100110011010101001011010101010010010100111111110101010001010001010101001110011001010100100101010011010101010011011000101011010101010011110010110101011101010101011011110010110010110111011010110011000110110100111011011101110101000101011010101000111001010100001110111001010101010101110010101110000010000100110011011101000110101100110001100011011000111100011001000101011010010101011001100000000100010001010011001010101010110100101011110101010001010010100100010001010


This is converted into a key:

Message we gave the system to encrypt:

Against stupidity the Gods themselves contend in vain.


The encrypted data is: b"!\x17\xcc7\xc78\t\xe9N\xd7R\x03\xf0'\x03\xa5\x01\xd0r=\xce\x0f\xb6\xed%\x1b\xd9\x08\xde\x1bO'\xe9\xcc\xdd,\xcc\x96\x8b\xc9\xd8\xf8/\xd0\xf6\xbeV\x87\xcc\x951Kt\xa4\x84" 

The decrypted data is:  Against stupidity the Gods themselves contend in vain.




# Conclusion

In this project w
The use of hall effect sensors is not recommended for such a set up, they break very easily and something more reliable would serve much better.
